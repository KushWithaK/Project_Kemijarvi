# Project_Kemijarvi
Project Kemijarvi ("PK Game") is Multi-Platform Game Development Project
{ Founded on 07/27/2023 by KushWithaK - "To teach my children of the world" }

The aim is to create a game that players will enjoy both offline & online,
something you can play for minutes or hours at a time while still enjoying it.

PK Game is the first game that will truly allow you to still participate and 
progress in the game while being completely away from your device &/ Logged-out
completely through a Auto-Activating Command/Script-based Macro System.
